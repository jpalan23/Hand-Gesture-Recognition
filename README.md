# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Gestures are a powerful mode of communication and they play a major role in human computer interaction. Hand gesture recognition is one of the necessary technique used to build eco-friendly interfaces as it helps in human-to-human and human-to-computer communication. The main idea of this project is to create a vision-based system to detect some Indian hand gestures from video sequences. In our project we consider the computer camera as an input device for obtaining the hand gestures. The gestures are detected using the structure analysis and shape detectors. Using the vision concepts and OpenCV methods we plan to detect few of the many gestures.
